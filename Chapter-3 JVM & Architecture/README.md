## What is JVM?
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE).
In other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a particular system. However, Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine.

## How JVM Works ?
First, Java code is complied into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.
JVM is responsible for allocating memory space. When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM.
