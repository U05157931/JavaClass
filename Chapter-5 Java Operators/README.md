## Java Operators
Operators are special symbols (characters) that carry out operations on operands (variables and values). Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −

1) Arithmetic Operators
2) Relational Operators
3) Bitwise Operators
4) Logical Operators
5) Assignment Operators
    
## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra.

Example :
INPUT
```
// Following is an example − Arithmetic Operator

public class Arithmetic{ 
      
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
      
    int a = 10, b = 4, result; 
   
    //printing a and b 
    System.out.println("a is "+a+ " and b is "+ b); 
   
    result = a+b; //addition 
    System.out.println("a+b is "+result); 
   
    result = a-b; //subtraction 
    System.out.println("a-b is "+result); 
   
    result = a*b; //multiplication 
    System.out.println("a*b is "+result); 
   
    result = a/b; //division 
    System.out.println("a/b is "+result); 
   
    result = a%b; //modulus 
    System.out.println("a%b is "+result); 
      
    } 
} 
```

OUTPUT :

```
a + b = 30
a - b = 10
x + y = ThankYou
a * b = 200
a / b = 2
a % b = 0
```
